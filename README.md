## THE name quiz app:
* note - Instead of creating an app with 3 activities we have gone with single activity,
  and put the logic in 2 fragments instead of 3, to reduce redundancy of logic.

## Features:
* Dependency injection
* Splash screen
* Navigation architecture

This template assumes that you will use:
- Kotlin
- Data binding
- Single activity architecture with NavController

Configured with:
- Kotlin DSL gradle
